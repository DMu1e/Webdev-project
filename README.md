# Work Book 

## General Project Description

WorkBook is a web based platform designed to make communication between students and teachers easier and more effective. It provides a better alternative to using informal messaging apps or traditional email by creating a space that is built specifically for academic interaction.

The platform allows students and educators to join group chats where they can share messages, documents, and images in a secure and organized way. Instead of managing scattered WhatsApp groups or long email chains, users can connect in real time, collaborate on projects, and stay focused on learning.

With a simple interface and tools made for education, WorkBook helps improve engagement, supports better collaboration, and keeps everyone on the same page.
