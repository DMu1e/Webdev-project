We are building a web platform similar to Reddit where users can rate, review, and rank movies and books theyâ€™ve read or watched. Users can also join or create chat rooms to discuss their thoughts with others. Based on their ratings and favorite genres, the system will recommend similar books or movies they might enjoy next.
